            "description": "During my time as an Aircraft Service Intern at Líder Aviation, the largest executive aviation company in Latin America, I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience in a variety of areas. During this period, I was involved in various aspects of crew and passenger service, internal sales utilizing the Oracle tool, the aircraft billing process, and contact with federal and private agencies to facilitate the entrance of aircraft on the airport. One of the most rewarding aspects of my role was participating in the accreditation process for employees at two airports. This involved working with a team to ensure that all necessary certifications and qualifications were in place, and that all employees were fully prepared to provide the highest level of service to passengers and clients. Through these experiences, I gained a deep appreciation for the complexity and intricacy of the aviation industry. I also developed strong communication, organization, and problem-solving skills that will serve me well in any future roles I take on. Overall, my time at Líder Aviation was an incredibly enriching experience that helped me to grow both personally and professionally."
